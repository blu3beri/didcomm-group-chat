DIDComm is a promising technology. Although it finds its origin in the space of
self-sovereign identity and is primarily used for the exchange of verifiable
credentials and presentations, its potential stretches far beyond. One
application where DIDComm has potential is group chat.

We envisage a group chat of up to 1,000 people who do not necessarily trust
each other. The key challenge in a P2P set-up without a centralised server is
the distribution of messages between multiple participants. Hence, we propose a
semi-decentralised solution employing more than one relays to facilitate
message routing to all group members. This is to prevent central control.

Such a DIDComm-based chat protocol can be used by anyone who is looking for a
communication mechanism for their group. By building atop of DIDComm we inherit
all the security and privacy support as defined in the specification.
